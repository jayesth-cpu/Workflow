 basic git commands 

1. clone: this command is used to clone a repo on our local machine(pc, laptop) git clone <link>
2. status: displays the status of our code untracked: new files that git doesn't yet track modified: changed staged: file is ready to be committed unmodified: unchanged 
3. add : adds new changed file in your working directory git add <file name> or git add .
4. commit : it is the record of change git commit -m “some meaningful message”
5. push: upload local committed repo content to the remote repo(github) git push origin main
git log : used to get a log of all commits made



Init Command

init : it is used to create a new repo

git init
git remote add origin < repo link >     
git remote -v                                     (used to verify the repo)
git branch                                          ( by default it will show master we’ll have to change it to main)
git branch -M main                           (this is used to change the name)
git push origin main                          (initially you can use git push -u origin main and then afterward you’ll have to use git push)


Branch Command 

git branch                              (to check which branch you are in)
git branch -M main               (to rename a branch)
git checkout <branch name>        (to navigate to a different branch)
git checkout -b <new branch name>   ( to create a new branch)
git branch -d <branch name>               (to delete a branch, you won’t be able to delete a branch if you’re already into that branch)


Merging Code
git diff <branch name(different from which you’re currently in)>              (this is used to compare the differences between the two branches)
git merge <branch name>                  (this is used to merge two branches)



Another way of merging a branch is through github by creating pull requests.

After merging the branches, changes will get reflected on the github itself but won’t reflect on the local repo it will be visible only on the remote repo. 
Therefore to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content we use 

Pull Command
git pull origin main         (this command is used to pull files from github to your local repo to assess the github changes.


Merge conflicts can arise when in two different branches two different changes have been done at the same point.  


Undoing Changes 

Case 1: staged changes 
git reset <file name>
git reset                        (this will be used to reset changes in all files)


Case 2: committed changes
git reset HEAD~1 

from git log, we can see the hash of the previous commits made
 so we can write  -      git reset <hash>    to directly jump to that particular commit      (this will remove changes from the git)

git reset —hard <hash>        (this command will remove the changes from vs code as well)




Fork 
a fork is a new repo that shares code and visibility settings with the original main repo. It is like a rough copy.
No there
